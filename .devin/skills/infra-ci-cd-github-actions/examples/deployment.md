## Pattern 9: Deployment Workflows Examples

### Multi-Environment Deployment

```typescript
// deployment-config.ts
export const DEPLOYMENT_CONFIG = {
  ENVIRONMENTS: {
    PREVIEW: {
      NAME: "preview",
      URL_PATTERN: "pr-{{number}}.example.com",
      AUTO_DEPLOY: true,
      REQUIRE_APPROVAL: false,
    },
    STAGING: {
      NAME: "staging",
      URL: "staging.example.com",
      AUTO_DEPLOY: true,
      REQUIRE_APPROVAL: false,
    },
    PRODUCTION: {
      NAME: "production",
      URL: "example.com",
      AUTO_DEPLOY: true,
      REQUIRE_APPROVAL: true,
      APPROVAL_TIMEOUT_MINUTES: 60,
    },
  },
  ARTIFACT_RETENTION_DAYS: 30,
} as const;
```

          body: |
            Deployed commit ${{ github.sha }} to production.

            ### Changes
            ${{ github.event.head_commit.message }}
        # Note: Requires contents: write permission (inherited from GITHUB_TOKEN default)
```

**Why good:** Single build artifact promoted through all environments ensures consistency, preview deployments for every PR enable visual review before merge, environment protection on production requires manual approval, artifact retention preserves builds for rollback capability

```yaml
# Bad Example - Rebuild for each environment
jobs:
  deploy-staging:
    steps:
      - run: bun run build # Build with staging config
      - run: deploy-staging

  deploy-production:
    steps:
      - run: bun run build # Rebuild with production config
      - run: deploy-production
```

**Why bad:** Rebuilding for each environment creates "works in staging but not production" bugs, different build artifacts per environment violates immutable infrastructure principle, slower deployments waiting for rebuild, wasted CI resources rebuilding identical code

### Rollback Procedures

```yaml
# Good Example - Rollback to previous deployment
name: Rollback Production

on:
  workflow_dispatch:
    inputs:
      deployment-id:
        description: "Vercel deployment ID to rollback to"
        required: true

jobs:
  rollback:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    environment:
      name: production

    steps:
      - name: Rollback Vercel deployment
        run: |
          # Promote previous deployment to production
          curl -X PATCH "https://api.vercel.com/v9/deployments/${{ github.event.inputs.deployment-id }}/promote" \
            -H "Authorization: Bearer ${{ secrets.VERCEL_TOKEN }}" \
            -H "Content-Type: application/json"

      - name: Notify team
        uses: slackapi/slack-github-action@v2
        with:
          webhook: ${{ secrets.SLACK_WEBHOOK }}
          webhook-type: incoming-webhook
          payload: |
            text: "Warning: Production rolled back to deployment ${{ github.event.inputs.deployment-id }}"
```

**Why good:** Manual trigger (workflow_dispatch) prevents accidental rollbacks, deployment-id parameter allows rollback to any previous version, instant rollback via Vercel API no rebuild required, Slack notification alerts team immediately
